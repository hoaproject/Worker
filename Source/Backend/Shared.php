/**
 * Class \Hoa\Worker\Backend\Shared.
 *
 * A shared worker is like a daemon, but it builds an internal server that
 * receives messages. According to these messages, an action is performed
 * by the help of the “message” listener.
 * A shared worker behaves like a daemon without the need of fork. It must run
 * behind PHP-FPM because we need the fastcgi_finish_request() function that
 * close the current FastCGI request but not the program execution. Then, the
 * internal server is started and continues to live in a PHP-FPM process. Well,
 * we have a daemon :-).
 * How to use it? Easy.
 * Your program:
 *     • __construct;
 *     • run.
 * Your “worker starter” (see $ hoa worker:start):
 *     • start.
 * Your “worker stopper” (see $ hoa worker:stop):
 *     • __construct;
 *     • stop.
 * To construct the worker, we need a socketable object for the internal server.
 * To start the worker, we need a socketable object to the PHP-FPM server.
 * When the shared worker is stopped, the associated .wid file (if exists) is
 * removed.
